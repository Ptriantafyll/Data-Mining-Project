# Data-Mining-Project
Machine Learning project 

the csv files are the datasets used in the project

Operations of main:

on dataset winequality.csv: 

~find best parameters for svm classifier and print scores

~remove 33% of the column 'pH' and then using the best classifier found do:
1) remove completely the column pH 
2) fill NaN values with the average of the values of the column that are not 'NaN'
3) fill NaN values using logistic Regression 
4) fill NaN values using KMeans (clustering)

on dataset onion-or-not.csv:
~preprocess titles of movies and classify using neural networks (MLP classifier)


How to run: download the csv files and then depending on what action of the above you want to do go to the end of Main and uncomment the lines you want to run
